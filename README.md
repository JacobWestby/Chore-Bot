# Chore-Bot
CodeCademy project Chore bot


Im feeling pretty proud of this one. Yes it's a simple game but i felt really confident writing it, like i actually knew what i was doing.
This lesson has a lot of handholding from codecademy's side in the 'hints' but i only used them to check my work. The whole lesson
almost felt too easy, which was a nice change of pase (trying to not gett cocky :P). 

The score counter was completley self implemented. It is not part of the lesson. No googling was involed, yes it's also pretty simple but
it's the little vicotries that count :) Overall verry happy whith it.
